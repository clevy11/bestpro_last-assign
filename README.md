1. What is Logging?
Logging is the process of recording application events, errors, and other important information during the execution of a program. It helps developers and system administrators track the application's behavior, diagnose problems, and understand its performance.

2. Why Logging is Important
Troubleshooting: Logs provide insights into what went wrong and where, making it easier to debug issues.
Monitoring: Helps track the application’s health, usage, and performance over time.
Audit Trails: Records user actions and system events for security and compliance purposes.
Performance Analysis: Assists in identifying performance bottlenecks and optimizing the application.

3. Understanding Logging Levels
Logging levels indicate the severity of the events being logged. Common levels include:

TRACE: Detailed information, typically useful for diagnosing issues.
DEBUG: Informational events that are helpful during development and debugging.
INFO: General information about the application’s operation (e.g., startup, shutdown).
WARN: Potential issues that may need attention but are not critical.
ERROR: Errors that indicate a problem has occurred, potentially affecting functionality.
FATAL: Severe errors that cause the application to terminate.
